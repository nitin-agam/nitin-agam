üéØ Dedicate yourself to your goals and stay focused on the things and activities to achieve them.

üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I believe in trying something different things rather than sticking to the stuff I already know since innovation is the key here. Software development is a team game and I always try to make myself more efficient and compatible with my team members; this also gives me an extra edge to apply my knowledge wherever possible. I'm passionate about developing readable, clean, maintainable source code and delivering quality products.
